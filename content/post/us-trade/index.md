Ok so now we see a bit more clearly what will go on this time. We already have 2 Secretaries [doing the same thing](https://x.com/SenWarren/status/1856541693836734783) (not that they are in charge of efficiency.. oh wait..); an Irak medical unit veteran as spy in chief and an anti-vax in charge of Health policies. Doing great so far.

## The Theory

**The obvious question that is on everyone's mind is the impact on global trade**. Now when facing this wide question, my first reaction is always to go back to theory. So the classic trade framework (check Krugman's very clear textbook in case of doubt) tells you that consumer are worse off (a+b+c+d) -- and this is not compensated by producers' gain (a) -- but the government can get an extra revenue (c+e), and that the importing country will see an appreciation of its currency.

Now, I don't want to dwell too much on the mathematics here (a simple review of local projection can be found [here](https://www3.nd.edu/~nmark/Climate/Jorda_LPsForAppliedEconomics.pdf)), but [this](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25402/w25402.pdf) paper covers a broad time span (1963-2014) and wide variety of countries (151 actually) and is quiet clear on one thing: it does look grim. **Tariffs have an adverse impact on output, productivity, they increase unemployment and inequality and had little impact on trade balance** (because of the offset of exchange rates). In a nutshell, that might have worked with the Corn Laws and perhaps for new sectors, but not anymore. *La fete est finie*. History is full of other examples but an intellectually stimulating discussion is to be found (again) in [Trade talks](https://tradetalkspodcast.com/podcast/49-are-trumps-steel-quotas-worse-than-his-steel-tariffs/).

That's for the theory. And I remember that **when Trump announced in 2018 the start of its trade war everyone went berserk**. Trump's administration imposed import tariffs on approximately $283 billion of US imports, with rates ranging between 10 and 50%, one of the most iconic measure being the one on steel and aluminium. In response, US trading partners, especially China, retaliated with tariffs averaging 16% on approximately $121 billion of US exports, plunging the United States into its first episode of large-scale reciprocal tariff protection since the Great Depression of the 1930s (nice applications of game theory to trade can be found in [Grossman and Helpman](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118226?seq=4) or the [Brander-Spencer model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brander%E2%80%93Spencer_model)). A nice graphical breakdown was [done](https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/measuring-trumps-2018-trade-protection-five-takeaways) by the PIIE. The ECB was [saying](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/focus/2018/html/ecb.ebbox201806_01.en.html) that the net effect on US output would be -2.2% (and -0.8% for the world's GDP); IMF was [estimating](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-october-2019) an effect of [-0.3%;-0.6%] on US output in 2020. OECD was on the same [line](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-economic-outlook-volume-2019-issue-1_b2e897b0-en.html).

## The Empirics

**And then guess what happened ? Well exactly what the theory projected**. An April 2019 U Chicago [study](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_201961-1.pdf) found that after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on washing machines, washer prices increased by $86 per unit and dryer prices increased by $92 per unit, due to package deals, ultimately resulting in an aggregate increase in consumer costs of over $1.5 billion. An October 2019 [paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf) by Alberto Cavallo et. al. found tariffs on imports from China were almost fully passed through to US import prices but only partially to retail consumers, implying some businesses absorbed the higher tariffs, reducing retail margins. In December 2019, Federal Reserve economists Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce [found](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf) a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs, suggesting that the benefit of increased production in protected industries was outweighed by the consequences of rising input costs and retaliatory tariffs. But the prize goes to D. Autor et al in January 2024 [concluding](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32082#fromrss) that import tariffs had "*neither a sizable nor significant effect on US employment in regions with newly‐​protected sectors*" and foreign retaliation "*by contrast had clear negative employment impacts, particularly in agriculture*".

**While it did [curb](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2024/americans-have-been-paying-tariffs-imports-china-decades) Chinese imports, it didn't do much for the trade deficit**. It leaves you wondering: would people be willing to trade off inflation for home production? Often one would say this is probably an *elasticity* question. It does also beg a wider question for those of you who love administratology (rather than legal) question on whether the President has a tyrannic power over trade policy. The Economist did a pretty [neat job](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/11/27/does-donald-trump-have-unlimited-authority-to-impose-tariffs) at summarizing it.

**We are talking about it but really no one knows right?** "It could go either way". The FT had a [funny article](https://www.ft.com/content/66a13524-6d4b-4927-b9fb-b97ded2aefbb) about how D. Trump is a game theory master by using these "*mixed strategies*". And if you want the theory behind without any reference to the [Young Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS9OO0S5w2k) you can get it [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45147414?seq=1): under specific assumptions opaque schemes (I felt that the idea was a bit similar to shirking in the Shapiro-Stiglitz model) dominate transparent ones. My very good friend Antoine translated that in an even funnier way, linking the "[madman theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory#:~:text=The%20madman%20theory%20is%20a,in%20fear%20of%20an%20unpredictable)" to Erasme. You get the idea.

**The new wave of trade tariffs is under way and Trump has already announced that Mexico and Canada will not be left alone**. So the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024) kinda reran the numbers and -- surprise surprise -- the effect is the same. Across regions, the impact on the United States is larger, because US trade flows are subject in their entirety to the new tariffs: GDP falls by 40 basis points in 2025 and by 60 in 2026 compared to the baseline projections. It's a chunky report but I would definitely recommend chapter 3 which delves into the details of social acceptability of structural reforms. I feel that finally the reluctance of macro to behavorial economics is coming to an end. We overcame rationality at individual level but now a growing body of literature is looking at this from a wholistic, policy-oriented perspective. Ulrike Malmendier [says](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/03/New-lessons-from-behavioral-economics-Malmendier-Hamilton) that better than me when she talks about Depression babies ... and [banks with falling capital ratios](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151093)!

## The Cultural Corner

**What to watch?** Of course *Dune: Prophecy* if you want to see Ragnar Lothbrok doing Ragnar things but in a magical environment. Mark Strong does not live up to his name but we forgive him. Same topic, different setting I really like *The Successor*. It revisits Sophocles' *Antigon* and asks interesting questions on innate and acquired characteristics.

**What to read?** Mandatory Goncourt reading, I am in the middle of *Houris* by Kamel Daoud.

**What to listen to?** "[This is love](https://open.spotify.com/track/0DZ3Z2MrXZkc5YLaKNlkN2?si=54c06393b0804eb9)" by Snazzy is a banger that deserves recognition, give it a try. Also rediscovering some of the rap classics of my youth such as "[Don't you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ54YcmdEBY)" by Jeezy.. of course the album's title is topical... Waiting for my year review as well!
