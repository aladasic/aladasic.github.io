## About Me

Hi ! I'm a 5 years' experienced public servant with a background in finance and public policies. I have worked in the private sector within financial markets (Goldman Sachs) and the tech sector (AWS), but i have spent most of my time in the public sector (French Ministry of Finance, French Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland). My experience to date has focused on promoting international financial stability, public regulatory and economic interests. These are also the fields that I am interested in for my part-time PhD @Trinity, when I'm not taking care of my lovely cat, Isadora. Views expressed are my own. Feel free to get in touch - AL
